## How It's Made

**Tech used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Bootstrap adds lightning fast responsiveness to this page. Gifs were created using OBS screen recording software, refined using Avidemux, and further optimized for correct sizing and file size/type before finally adding them to the site and lastly 'lazy loaded' to improve performance. 

## Optimizations

Optimzing the playback and experemienting with various file formats for a live feature of the wesbites showcased was a challenge. I ended up using a combination of gifs to get them looking and feeling right on all devices. 

## Lessons Learned

Bootstrap spacing was my biggest learning experience next to the video editing/recording skills I gained with this project. In the future I would like to dive into 3.js and create a more interactive experience for the user.
